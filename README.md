# StockBot

I created this bot (a work in progress) after watching the video "Building a Conversational Bot: From 0 to 60"
https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B821
https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/tree/master/CSharp/Samples/Build-2016

The code that I wrote is using version 3 while the video is using an older version.

The Stock bot is able to retreive stock quotes by using the Yahoo finance API by supplying either the ticker symbol alone, 
or by asking a question using naturall language such as "Show me the value of msft"
